## Progress Summary
#### Current Progress:
- **Frontend**:
  - Fixed API errors and displayed different types of weather data.
  - Implemented a 5-day weather forecast and unit conversion (e.g., Celsius to Fahrenheit).
- **Backend**:
  - Developed login and register pages with user authentication.
  - Implemented token storage and session handling.
  - Created and connected a database for storing user data.
- **CI/CD**:
  - Set up a GitHub Actions pipeline for testing and deployment.
- **Overall Status**:
  - Major functionalities (API integration, user authentication, and CI/CD setup) are complete.
  - Pending UI/UX refinements and additional testing.

#### Remaining Tasks:
- Finalize UI/UX for weather dashboard and login/register pages.
- Conduct end-to-end testing for all features.
- Add more advanced user account features, such as dashboard customization.
- Include support for favorite locations and sharing options.
- Optimize performance for deployment readiness.

### Reflection on Process
#### What's Working:
- Clear and effective task delegation among team members.
- Proper integration of frontend and backend components.
- Successful CI/CD pipeline implementation.

#### Challenges:
- Resolving API errors from the previous milestone.
- Debugging token storage and session management took longer than expected.

#### Improvements Needed:
- Improve synchronization between team members for frontend and backend development.
- Enhance the testing process to catch errors earlier in the pipeline.
